# 🛡️ Privacy Policy for Radon

**Last updated:** July 22, 2025

Thanks for using **Radon**! I respect your privacy and want to be transparent about how your data is handled.

## 🔍 What I Collect

Radon does **not collect any personal information** — no names, emails, or anything identifiable.

The only thing I collect is **crash logs** when something goes wrong, to help me fix bugs and improve the app. These logs do **not** contain personal data.

## 🌐 Browsing Through WebView2

Radon uses **WebView2** to load web content. I don’t track or collect what you browse — but the websites you visit might. Each site has its own privacy practices (like cookies or analytics), which are outside of my control.

## 💾 Data Storage

All your browsing data and settings are saved **locally on your device**. I do not sync or store anything on any servers.

## 👶 Children’s Privacy

Radon is not intended for children under 13. Since I don’t collect personal data, I also don’t knowingly collect any information from children.
